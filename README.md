# Fileorg

The goal of this project is to be able to run a command, `fileorg`, in a directory, and
sort all of the files in it into sub directories based on their filetype/extension. Optionally,
if there are a lot of files (like a bunch of photos), it could organize them into further
subdirectories based on when they were created. It's a WIP!
